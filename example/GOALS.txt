[DONE] Create an image viewing program which opens up a target image folder, opens the first image in fullscreen format (filling the viewer window, respecting aspect ratio), then listens to the following input actions:

[DONE] - arrow key left: prev image in folder (looping back to first)
[DONE] - arrow key right: next image in folder
[DONE] - number key: copy the image to a subfolder (creating it if it doesnt exist yet) within the current folder named ./<number_key>/  so e.g. ./3
[DONE] - delete: deletes the image and moves to the next
[DONE] - Implement error handling and improve user feedback

Next steps:
1. [DONE] Create unit tests for the image viewer functions
   [DONE] - Test load_images function
   [DONE] - Test move_or_copy_image function
   [DONE] - Test display_image function
   [DONE] - Test update_display function
   [DONE] - Test main function
2. [IN PROGRESS] Optimize performance for large image collections
   [DONE] - Implement lazy loading mechanism
   [DONE] - Add image caching
   [DONE] - Implement background preloading of images
   [DONE] - Refactor code for better modularity and maintainability
   TODO - Profile and further optimize if needed
3. Add additional features (e.g., zoom, rotate, slideshow mode)
4. Improve code documentation and add usage instructions to README.md
5. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
6. Add configuration options (e.g., customizable keybindings, display settings)
