Current general development mode we should be operating in (update this according to overall strategy)

CURRENT MODE: <select current mode>


Available modes:

ANALYSIS - analyze, summarize, document, printout, and understand all aspects of the program - especially unknowns like runtime behavior and error states.

CONSTRUCTION - adding features and performance in alignment with instructions and goals.

DECONSTRUCTION 
	- splitting, modularizing, and minimizing the codebase, to separate concerns into smaller self-contained submodule pieces which can be managed on their own.  
	- This may involve creating functional programming functions, classes, or mini libraries in separate subfolders modules operating on their own
	- Any submodule created should follow the same fractal pattern, with its own GOALS.txt and STATUS.txt according to the subproblem it is trying to solve. It should have a copy of INSTRUCTIONS.txt, and MODE.txt.
